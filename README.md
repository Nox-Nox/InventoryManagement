## InventoryManagement

This is my last Project in javaFX.
in this project I wanted to develope a better version of my previous barcode-scanner project to get an idea of how much i have improved.

Unlike the previous project in this one i used:
- embedded database (H2) for data persistence
- create functions
- reduce boilerplate code
- find item with the barcode scanner device without using a text field by adding a listener


### Need to make some revisions
